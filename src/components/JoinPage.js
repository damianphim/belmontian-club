        <h2>Join the Belmontian Club</h2>
        <p>
          The Belmontian Club provides BHS students with volunteer and community service opportunities. We also host our own events, such as the yearly Sock Drive or Snowflakes Fundraiser.
          By participating in our volunteer opportunities, you will not only contribute to meaningful causes but also develop valuable skills in leadership, teamwork, and organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're interested in joining our efforts and becoming a part of this club, we invite you to visit us in Room A421 after school on every other Thursday.
          Our biweekly meetings provide an opportunity to learn more about upcoming service projects, connect with other members, and contribute your ideas to help shape our initiatives.
